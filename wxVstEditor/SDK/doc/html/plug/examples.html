<h1>VST Plug-Ins Examples</h1>
  			 
<p> 				This SDK comes with 7 examples of Plug-Ins. Each time both Windows 
(VisualC++ 6  				and Visual .Net) (except for Offline)&nbsp;and Mac OSX (CodeWarrior
8.3 and  				ProjectBuilder) projects are provided. 			</p>

<h2><a href="2.0/examples.html#AGain">AGain</a></h2>
  			 
<p> 				AGain is a very simple VST Plug-In, but which demonstrates everything 
you have  				to know concerning the core API in order to start building your
own Plug-Ins.<br>
  				Indeed this example should help you understand how to deal with the 
audio  				process, and with parameters and programs : an audio Plug-In is 
actually no  				more than that! 				<br>
  				Nevertheless, this Plug-In uses the default editor provided by the
host to  				display its parameters : nothing concerning specific GUI stuff
is provided with  				this example. But keeping in mind that in a VST Plug-In 
the user interface is  				totally independant from the core API, this example 
is a good starting point,  				even to be able later to build Plug-Ins with 
their own editor.<br>
  			</p>
  			<br>

<h2><a href="2.0/examples.html#ADelay">ADelay</a>, ADelayEdit, ADelaySurround</h2>
  			 
<p> 				Those three examples consist in a natural way you will perhaps want 
to follow  				to make a Plug-In evolve.<br>
  			</p>
  			<br>
  			 
<h4>ADelay</h4>
  			 
<p> 				ADelay is the first step : a simple delay Plug-In which uses the default
editor  				provided by the host. By the way it's nothing really more than
what you can  				find in AGain above.<br>
  			</p>
  			<br>
  			 
<h4>ADelayEdit</h4>
  			 
<p> 				ADelayEdit uses ADelay, but it provides a specific editor for the 
Plug-In. Thus  				evolving from ADelay to ADelayEdit mainly consists in creating
this editor :  				the core Plug-In reuses what has yet been done.<br>
  				The editor is developped using the VSTGUI (see the specific section 
for further  				information on this topic) library.<br>
  			</p>
  			<br>
  			 
<h4>ADelaySurround</h4>
  			 
<p> 				ADelaySurround is the surround version of ADelayEdit : it has the 
same editor,  				the same parameters and even the same audio process. But 
it implements new  				features provided by VST 2.3 to be able to work with 
any Input/Output  				configuration, until 6 Ins, 6 Outs.<br>
  			</p>

<h2>ControlsGUI</h2>
  			 
<p>This is not really a plugin (it does nothing). It has only a User Interface 
 				using almost all provided Controls of VSTGUI Library. It helps you understand 
 				how you can use the VSTGUI Library.</p>
  			 
<hr noshade size="4">
<h2>Offline</h2>
  			 
<p>This example (only for Windows) helps you to understand how the VST Offline 
 				Interface could be used. The Host&nbsp;Application <strong>Wavelab</strong> 
implements  				it.</p>
  			 
<hr noshade size="4">
<h2>VstXSynth</h2>
  			 
<p>This is a soft synth ("VST instrument") example. It helps you to understand 
how  				you can tell the host that you would like to receive MIDI events, 
and how to  				deal with them. That's nearly the only new thing you have 
to know to be able to  				create VSTi! Everything else has been seen in the
previous examples!</p>
