	<h1><a name="AGain">Basic Programming Examples<br>
    			A simple gain-change plug-in.</a></h1>
    <br>
	You may ask why we are diving right into a programming example. Well
 the answer  		is clear, creating a VST plug-in is easy and we don&#8217;t want
to cloud the issue.  		If the SDK is standing in the way of understanding
something relatively  		uncomplicated, then something has gone wrong.
	<br>
    <br>
	This example is very simple and the resulting plug-in does not really 
 do  		anything interesting, but it does show the how uncomplicated creating 
 a VST  		plug-in can be. The example source files can be found in the accompanying 
  		&#8216;examples&#8217; folder along with project files for the various platforms.<br>
    <br>
    		Please note that when you start experimenting with these examples we
 have  		marked the places where you should make your changes if these examples 
 were to  		be used as templates for your own plug-ins.<br>
    <br>
    		Before getting our programming feet wet, maybe we should cover just 
a  couple of  		background points that will help with understanding the following 
 code  		fragments.

    						<li> 							The constructor of your class is passed a parameter

 and the host passes an object of type <code>audioMasterCallback</code> 							that 
 handles the interaction with the plug-in. You pass this on to the base  							class&#8217;s
 constructor and then can forget about it.<br>

    						<li> 							Finally your class gets to over-ride both of two possible 
 member functions that  							actually do the work. These are repeatedly 
called by the host application, each  							time with a new block of data. 
These member functions have only three  							parameters: a pointer to the 
data, a pointer to where you can write modified  							data to, and how big
the block is. 						</li>

    		<p>
    		That's all there is to it! That cannot have hurt too much. So let&#8217;s walk through all that again and explain what&#8217;s where.<br>
    		<br>
    		To recap, apart from a very small &#8216;main&#8217; function that resides in another file, which is used by the host to construct your plug-in, you really 
have seen the complete code for an VST plug-in, admittedly it does not really do much.<br>
    		<br>
    		Your plug-in class is derived from AudioEffectX and provides is own processing methods, and that&#8217;s all you need to create a VST plug-in that 
uses the  host&#8217;s default method for displaying its parameters.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		</p>
     
<h2>How does it work?</h2>

    		<p>Before proceeding with the description of the plug-in code fragment,
 we will  		take a short look at a skeleton code fragment from the host-side. 
 That is, the  		application code associated with supporting VST-Plug-ins 
in an application.  		This SDK does not handle the host-side implementation 
of VST Plug-ins and the  		code here is purely for understanding purposes.<br>
    		<br>
    		First, when the Application instanciates a plug-in, it calls the plug-ins 
 main  		() function somewhat like this:<br>
    		<br>
    		</p>
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
typedef AEffect *(*mainCall)(audioMasterCallback cb);
audioMasterCallback audioMaster;

void instanciatePlug (mainCall plugsMain)
{   			   
	AEffect *ce = plugsMain (&amp;audioMaster);
	if (ce &amp;&amp; ce-&gt;magic == AEffectMagic)
    {
    	....
    }

}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>It&#8217;s all pretty elementary stuff, our instanciatePlug() function 
 takes a  		typedef&#8217;d pointer to the <code>main()</code> function in our plug-in
 code. Our  		plug&#8217;s <code>Main()</code> is then called with the audioMaster
 data which we  		have already established is:<br>
    		<br>
    		   
<ul>
    			<li> 				Data, controlling the interchange between the host and the
 plug-in</li>
    			<li> 				Passed on to the constructor of the base-class <code>AudioEffectX</code></li>
    			<li> 				and is nothing to worry about.</li>
    		   
</ul>
    		<br>
    		The host then gets a pointer to the plug-in, if all is well, and then 
 can check  		if it was actually a VST plug-in that was actually created.<br>
    		This is magic.<br>
    		<br>
    		Returning now to the plug-in code for this example, let&#8217;s have a look 
 at the <code>main()</code> 		function itself.<br>
    		This you can find in AGainMain.cpp.<br></p>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		</p>
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
#if BEOS
#define main main_plugin
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) AEffect *main_plugin (audioMasterCallback audioMaster);

#elif MACX
#define main main_macho
extern "C" AEffect *main_macho (audioMasterCallback audioMaster);

#else
AEffect *main (audioMasterCallback audioMaster);
#endif

//------------------------------------------------------------------------
AEffect *main (audioMasterCallback audioMaster)
{
	// Get VST Version
	if (!audioMaster (0, audioMasterVersion, 0, 0, 0, 0))
		return 0;  // old version

	// Create the AudioEffect
	ADelay* effect = new ADelay (audioMaster);
	if (!effect)
		return 0;
	
	// Check if no problem in constructor of AGain
	if (oome)
	{
		delete effect;
		return 0;
	}
	return effect->getAeffect ();
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		Firstly you can see that the <code>audioMasterCallback audioMaster</code> 
 is  		called with the <code>audioMasterVersion</code> flag just to check 
that our  		plug-in is being opened in a valid VST host.<br>
    		<br>
    		Next the constructor of our gain plug in is called. Unless something
 goes wrong  		(out of memory etc), and we return null to the VST host, then
 the resulting <code>effect</code> 		object has one of it&#8217;s member functions
 called <code>effect-&gt;getAeffect</code> (),  		and the result of this
call  is returned to the host.<br>
    		<br>
    		What&#8217;s actually being returned to the host is the C interface of our
 plug-in:  		We may be writing code in C++ but deep down there is a C structure
 filled with  		fields we need to know nothing about.<br>
    		<br>
    		Whenever the Host instanciates a plug-in, after the <code>main()</code> 
 call,  		it also immediately informs the plug-in about important system parameters
 like  		sample rate, and sample block size. Because the audio effect object
 is  		constructed in our plug-in&#8217;s main(), before the host gets any information
 about  		the created object, you need to be careful what functions are called
 within the  		constructor of the plug-in. You may be talking but no-one
is  listening.<br>
    		<br>
    		Let's look at some details of the gain example. First, the constructor:<br></p>
    		<br>
 </p>   		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
AGain::AGain (audioMasterCallback audioMaster)
: AudioEffectX (audioMaster, 1, 1)	// 1 program, 1 parameter only
{
	fGain = 1.;				// default to 0 dB
	setNumInputs (2);		// stereo in
	setNumOutputs (2);		// stereo out
	setUniqueID ('Gain');	// identify
	canMono ();				// makes sense to feed both inputs with the same signal
	canProcessReplacing ();	// supports both accumulating and replacing output
	strcpy (programName, "Default");	// default program name
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		Our plug-in&#8217;s constructor has the callback to the host as its parameter. 
 This  		is passed onto the <code>AudioEffectX</code> base-class where it 
is stored, but  		the constructor to the base-class also has two extra parameters 
 that set the  		number of programs the effect has, and the number of parameters 
 the host should  		&#8216;see&#8217; as user parameters for the plug-in.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
 </p>   		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td>Parameters are the individual parameter settings the user can 
adjust.<br>
    					A VST host can automate these parameters.<br>
    					<br>
    					Programs are a complete set of parameters that refer to the current 
 state of  					the plug-in.<br>
    					<br>
    					Banks are a collection of Program objects.<br>
    		</td>
       </tr>
           
  </tbody>   
</table>
<p>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		Our plug-in only has one parameter, namely the gain. This is a member 
 variable  		of our AGain class, and get initialized to 1.0, which translates 
 to 0dB. This  		value like all VST parameters is declared as a <code>float</code> 
 with a  		inclusive range of 0.0 to 1.0. How data is presented to the user 
 is merely in  		the userinterface handling.<br>
    		<br>
 </p>   		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					<b>Parameter </b>values are limited to the range 0.0 to 
1.0<br>
    			This is a convention, but still worth regarding. Maybe the VST-host&#8217;s 
  			automation system depends on this range. 		</td>
       </tr>
           
  </tbody>   
</table>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		<p>
    		Next the plug-in states the number of inputs and outputs it can process 
 with <code>setNumInputs(2)</code> 		&amp; <code>setNumOutputs(2);</code>
 		<br>
    		<br>
    		The plug-in next declares its unique identifier. The host uses this 
to  identify  		the plug-in, for instance when it is loading effect programs 
and banks.  		Steinberg will keep a record of all these IDs so if you want 
to, before  		releasing a plug-in ask us if anyone else has already said they
use to the ID.  		Otherwise be inventive; you can be pretty certain that
someone already has used  		&#8216;DLAY&#8217;.<br>
    		<br>
    		The call <code>canMono()</code> tells the host that it makes sense
to  use this  		plug-in as a 1 in / 2 out device. When the host has mono
effects  sends and has  		a stereo buss for the effects returns, then the
host can  check this flag to add  		it to the list of plug-ins that could
be used in  this way.<br>
    		<br>
    		In this instance the host can check to see if a stereo plug is selected, 
 and  		can decide to feed both inputs with the same signal.<br><br>
    		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					For the gain plug, this makes sense (although it would
be  much more efficient  					to have a separate 1 in / 2 out version), but 
a  stereo width enhancer, for  					instance, really doesn't make sense to 
be  used with both inputs receiving the  					same signal; such a plug should 
 definitely not call <code>canMono()</code> 			. 		</td>
       </tr>
           
  </tbody>   
</table>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		We then tell host that we support replacing processing with the call
 <code>canProcessReplacing()</code>  		(see &#8216;Basic Concepts&#8217; for more information).<br>
    		<br>
    		Finally, the one and only program name gets set to "Default" with <code>strcpy(programName, 
  			"Default")</code>. The program name is displayed in the rack, and can 
 be  		edited by the user.<br>
    		<br>
    		This gain plug-in only has one parameter so its handling of the hosts 
 requests  		for parameter information are very simple, in that the index 
to the parameter  		required is simply ignored, and either the current value 
 of our fGain member is  		set or returned.<br></p>

&amp; 1.0 as the <code>setParameter()</code>function  					gets called. If
you want a different relationship between the parameters that  					are automated 
 by the host and what is actually used in your processing method,  					then

    		<br>
    		<br>
    		When using the default host interface to provide an interface for a 
plug-in,  as  		we are doing here, it is necessary that effect object overrides 
the  following  		functions to allow the default interface a chance to display 
 useful values to  		the user. Note, here again we are ignoring the parameter 
 &#8216;index&#8217; while we only  		have one parameter.<br>

    		As you can see, the <code>AudioEffectX</code> base-class has some default

  		conversions, for instance here to display a dB value string. <code>dB2string(fGain, 
  			text)</code> . Please check the <code>audioeffectX.hpp</code> &amp; <code>AudioEffect.h</code>
 		files for the full compliment.<br></p>
    		   
<h2>So that's it ? !</h2>
<p>
    		Yes, that&#8217;s all you need to know to create a fully working VST plug-in. 
 If you  		already have an idea for an algorithm or audio process you could 
 test it out  		right now.<br>
    		<br>
    		Actually there are two different kinds of processes that you can support, 
 so  		it&#8217;s probably a good idea to keep on reading a little further.<br>
    		<br>
    		Anyway that's all there is to initialization, parameter handling, and 
 user  		interfacing in its simplest form.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		Now you should proceed to the ADelay example, which is similar to AGain 
 but has  		more parameters, and provides the basis for a plug-in with its 
 own graphical  		user interface.<br>

<h2>So what's new?</h2>

    		So after scanning through that you probably can see what&#8217;s familiar

step  by step&#8230;<br>

<br>
<br>
 <p>   		This enumerates all parameters that are accessible to the user. 
 It's a  		good habit to use such an enumerator for any plug-in. If our final 
 linked  		plug-in was dropped into the host&#8217;s VST Plug-in folder, then the 
 parameters we  		would see would be representations of these, namely the 
delay time, the output  		to input feedback amount, and the output level as
parameters.<br>

    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					While we are on the topic of good ideas, we would recommend 
 having at least one  					representation of these parameters in your plug-ins 
 main class that corresponds  					to the generic parameter format. In other 
 words, for each of these parameters  					declared in the enumeration there 
 should a (similarly named) parameter that  					holds it&#8217;s value, where the
 value is a float type between the values 0.0 and  					1.0 inclusive.<br>

    		<br>
    		<br>
    		The handling of programs, the snapshots of user settings, is going
to  need a  		container for each set of parameters. We define a class to
handle  this.<br>
    		<br>
</p>    		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
class ADelayProgram
{
friend class ADelay;
public:
	ADelayProgram ();
	~ADelayProgram () {}

private:	
	float fDelay;
	float fFeedBack;
	float fOut;
	char name[24];
};
</pre>
</div>		
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		The members, <code>fDelay, fFeedBack,</code> and <code>fOut</code>
are  the  		generic representations of the parameters as stored in this container. 
 They are  		not themselves the parameters used in the audio process but places
 where they  		will be copied from when the user selects another program. 
At this point the  		user can edit these values using the controls provided 
by the host using <code>setParameter()</code> 		&amp; <code>getParameter()</code>.
  		<br>
    		<br>
    		The same is true of the name, if this program was to be selected by 
the  user,  		after the plug-in has copied it from the container, the user 
can  use the host  		application to edit the name, which is achieved with 
<code>getProgramName()</code>  		and <code>setProgramName()</code>.<br>
    		<br>
    		We will omit the method declarations and have a look at their implementation 
  		instead, firstly the ADelayProgram constructor:<br>
    		<br>
 </p>   		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
ADelayProgram::ADelayProgram ()
{
	// default Program Values
	fDelay = 0.5;
	fFeedBack = 0.5;
	fOut = 0.75;

	strcpy (name, "Init");
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		This simply sets the default parameter values for all programs. You 
might  want  		to assign different values (for instance, from a table or array)
for each  		program, in order to provide some useful presets. That's all
there is to the  		ADelayProgram class.<br>
    		<br>
    		So, back to the constructor of the ADelay class&#8230;<br>
    		<br>
    	</p>	
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
ADelay::ADelay (audioMasterCallback audioMaster)
: AudioEffectX (audioMaster, kNumPrograms, kNumParams)
{
	// init
	size = 44100;
	buffer = new float[size];
	
	programs = new ADelayProgram[numPrograms];
	fDelay = fFeedBack = fOut = 0;
	delay = inPos = outPos = 0;

	if (programs)
		setProgram (0);

	setNumInputs (1);	// mono input
	setNumOutputs (2);	// stereo output

	hasVu ();
	canProcessReplacing ();
	setUniqueID ('ADly');

	resume ();		// flush buffer
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		When the ADelay class is constructed, firstly the base-class AudioEffectX 
 is  		constructed. As you will remember from the AGain example, one of AudioEffectX&#8217;s 
  		arguments is the number of programs the plug-in has (here set to 2). Once
 the  		base class is constructed, during the construction of the ADelay object,
 the  		member variable numPrograms is valid and is used to construct a set
 of  		ADelayPrograms.<br>
    		<br>
    		Because this is a delay process we are going to need some memory to 
store   		samples. The parameter &#8216;size&#8217; is set to 44100 to provide a maximum 
of one  		second of delay, and then a buffer of floats is allocated.<br>
    		<br>
    		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					Probably a statement such as size = getSampleRate() would 
 be better, but as we  					don&#8217;t react to changes in sample rate in this 
simple example, and then anyway  					we would have to re-allocate the buffer 
accordingly etc. That&#8217;s not the point  					of this example.<br>
    				</td>
    		</tr>
           
  </tbody>   
</table>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		Next all the parameters that are used in the audio process are set
to  zero as a  		matter of good behavior, but actually they will get set
to an  initial value  		when setProgram() gets called if delay programs were 
successfully  created.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		Just as in the AGain example, <code>setUniqueID()</code> is very important, 
 you  		must set this to a value as unique as possible as the host uses this 
 to  		identify the plug-in, for instance when it is loading effect programs 
 and  		banks.<br>
    		<br>
    		Finally, we state that we support vu meters, and in-place processing
 as with  		the gain example. The destructor just takes care of cleaning
up  (remember,  		we're in the Hosts' context):<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
   </p> 		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
ADelay::~ADelay ()
{
	if (buffer)
		delete[] buffer;
	if (programs)
		delete[] programs;
}
</pre>
</div> 		
<br>
<br>
    		   
<h2>Changing Programs</h2>
<p>
    		Next we should have a look at the <code>setProgram()</code> method. 
This  is  		called whenever the user, or the host as a result of automation 
activity,  wants  		to change the current active program in the plug-in. This
(re-) initializes  		both generic, internal parameters, and variables:<br>
    		<br>
  </p>  		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
void ADelay::setProgram (long program)
{
	ADelayProgram * ap = &programs[program];

	curProgram = program;
	setParameter (kDelay, ap->fDelay);	
	setParameter (kFeedBack, ap->fFeedBack);
	setParameter (kOut, ap->fOut);
}
</pre>
</div> 		
<br>
<br>
<p>
    		It reads the parameters from the selected program, makes that the current 
  		program, and calls <code>setParameter()</code> for each of the indexed 
  		parameters, with the new values, just as if the user would have set them 
 by  		hand. It doesn&#8217;t matter why the parameters are being changed, user 
selection,  		automation, program change, the same <code>setParameter()</code> 
method gets  		called.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
</p>    		   
<h2>Changing Parameters</h2>
    		<p>Well, while we are on the subject of <code>setParameter()</code> we 
should  look  		at its implementation.<br>
    		<br>
    		</p>
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
void ADelay::setParameter (long index, float value)
{
	ADelayProgram * ap = &programs[curProgram];

	switch (index)
	{
		case kDelay :    setDelay (value); break;
		case kFeedBack : fFeedBack = ap->fFeedBack = value; break;
		case kOut :      fOut = ap->fOut = value; break;
	}
	if (editor)
		editor->postUpdate ();
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
    		<p>We'll get back to <code>setDelay()</code> later. The <code>setParameter()</code>
  		function is also called from the Host, it's important that we store the 
  		parameters back into the current program, to maintain the currently edited 
  		state of any particular program.<br>
    		<br>
    		Both <code>getParameter()</code> and <code>setParameter()</code> always 
 refer  		to the current program.<br>
    		<br>
    		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					But notice that last section referring to the editor. When 
 a parameter gets  					changed you want the user&#8217;s display to be updated 
as well. And here is exactly  					where you should NOT do it. The reason 
is that <code>setParameter</code> can &amp;  					will get called from interrupt 
 and drawing graphics from an interrupt (on the  					Mac!) is basically impossible.
 And we will leave it at that. There are actually  					performance reasons
 why deferring graphic updates to the user-interface thread  					is a good
 idea. What you actually do is post a message to the user-interface  					that
 something or everything needs updating.</td>
    		</tr>
           
  </tbody>   
</table>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		To complete the picture, here&#8217;s the implementation of <code>getParameter()</code>&#8230;<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
   </p> 		
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
float ADelay::getParameter (long index)
{
	float v = 0;

	switch (index)
	{
		case kDelay :    v = fDelay; break;
		case kFeedBack : v = fFeedBack; break;
		case kOut :      v = fOut; break;
	}
	return v;
}
</pre>
</div>		
<br>
<br>
    		<p>That&#8217;s simple enough. Compared with the version in AGain where we had 
 only one  		parameter, we use the index value to return the appropriate parameter.
  		Alternatively we could have returned values that referred to the program
 index  		by <code>curProgram</code>, but because we were so diligent in
how  <code>setProgram()</code> 		also updated the current program, there
was no  need.<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		There's also <code>getProgramName()</code> and <code>setProgramName()</code>: 
  		Remember the size of the character arrays, and the consequences of overfilling 
  		them?<br>
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		</p>
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
void ADelay::setProgramName (char *name)
{
	strcpy (programs[curProgram].name, name);
}

void ADelay::getProgramName (char *name)
{
	if (!strcmp (programs[curProgram].name, "Init"))
		sprintf (name, "%s %d", programs[curProgram].name, curProgram + 1);
	else
		strcpy (name, programs[curProgram].name);
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<p>Fairly straightforward as well. And as we have more than one 
parameter,   		we use switch statements where the Host asks us for strings. 
We still don&#8217;t  		have our own interface yet and must support the host&#8217;s efforts
in providing us  		with the generic interface.<br>
    		<br>
    		   
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000"
 width="80%" align="center">
    			<tbody>
       <tr>
    				<td> 					<b>Even if you do provide your own editor you should still

{

    		<p>This just a small detail really but the <code>AudioEffectX</code> base 
 class  		provides a number of conversion functions, we have already used 
<code>dB2string()</code> 		in the gain plug-in, but here <code>long2string()</code> 
and <code>float2string()</code> 		are used as well.<br>
    		<br>
    		We are getting close the to end of the new stuff here. Have a look
at  the  		method <code>resume()</code>.<br>
    		<br>
    	</p>	
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
void ADelay::resume ()
{
	memset (buffer, 0, size * sizeof (float));
	AudioEffectX::resume ();
}
</pre>
</div> 		
<br>
<br>
    		<p>This method <code>resume()</code> is called when the effect is turned 
 on by  		the user; the buffer gets flushed because otherwise pending delays 
 would sound. It&#8217;s not essential
 to do this  		but it would be rather strange not to, but there&#8217;s no accounting
 for taste.<br>
    		<br>
    		   
<h2>And Finally, the Process.</h2>
    		<br>
    		<div class="cpp"><pre>
void ADelay::process (float** inputs, float** outputs, long sampleFrames)
{
	float* in = inputs[0];
	float* out1 = outputs[0];
	float* out2 = outputs[1];

	while (--sampleFrames >= 0)
	{
		float x = *in++;
		float y = buffer[cursor];
		buffer[cursor++] = x + y * fFeedBack;
		if (cursor >= delay)
			cursor = 0;
		(*out1++) += y;
		if (out2)
			(*out2++) += y;
	}
}
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
    			<p>There is a buffer of (at least) the maximum number of samples to be
 delayed,  			reflected by the size member variable.
    			<br>
    			The details of the processes and are left for you to figure out by 
yourself.   			All in all, this is a simple delay with feedback.<br>
    			<br>
    			At this point, we have seen enough to understand the fundamental mechanisms 
 of  			writing VST plug-ins: Now complete with multiple parameters, that 
can be  			correctly automated and saved as programs, and displayed with labels
and value  			units by the host. Not bad for a few lines of code.<br>
    			<br>
    			Both the gain plug-in and this simple delay plug-in have used the
host&#8217;s   			default parameter handling for changing and displaying values.
Nothing  wrong  			with that, but VST plug-ins can also provide their own
user interface,  so that  			they can do customize their look and feel. In
the next example  code we will  			look at how the delay plug-in can be extended
to do just  that.<br>
