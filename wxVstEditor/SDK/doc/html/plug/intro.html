<h1>VST Plug-Ins Formal issues</h1>

<h2>What is a VST Plug-In?</h2>
 			
<p>In the widest possible sense a VST Plug-In is an audio process. A VST
Plug-In is  				not an application. It needs a host application that handles
the audio streams  				and makes use of the process the VST Plug-In supplies.</p>
 			
<p>Generally speaking, it can take a stream of audio data, apply a process
to the  				audio and send the result back the host application. A VST Plug-In
performs its  				process normally using the processor of the computer, it
does not necessarily  				need dedicated digital signal processors. The audio
stream is broken down into  				a series of blocks. The host supplies the
blocks in sequence. The host and its  				current environment control the
block-size. The VST Plug-In maintains all  				parameters statuses that refer
to the running process: The host does not  				maintain any information about
what the Plug-In did with the last block of data  				it processed. 			</p>
 			
<p>From the host application&#8217;s point of view, a VST Plug-In is a black box
with an  				arbitrary number of inputs, outputs (Midi or Audio), and associated
parameters.  				The Host needs no knowledge of the Plug-In process to be
able to use it.</p>
 			
<p>The Plug-In process can use whatever parameters it wishes, internally
to the  				process, but it can choose to allow the changes to user parameters
to be  				automated by the host, if the host application wishes to do so.</p>
 			
<p>The source code of a VST Plug-In is platform independent, but the delivery
 				system depends on the platform architecture. 			</p>

<h2>Processing Options</h2>
 			
<p>Audio processing in the plug is accomplished by one of 2 methods, namely
<em>process </em> 				(), and <em>processReplacing</em> (). The first one
must be provided, while the  				second one is optional (but it is highly
recommended to always implement both  				methods). While <em>process</em>
() takes input data, applies its pocessing  				algorithm, and then adds
the result to the output (accumulating), <em>processReplacing</em> 				()
overwrites the output buffer. The host provides both input and output  				buffers
for either process method.</p>
 			
<p>The reasoning behind the accumulating version (<em>process</em> ()) is
that it  				is much more efficient in the case where many processors operate
on the same  				output (aux-send bus), while for simple chained connection
schemes (inserts),  				the replacing method is more efficient.</p>
 			
<p>All parameters - the user parameters, acting directly or indirectly on
that  				data, as automated by the host, are 32 bit floating-point numbers.
They must  				always range from <strong>0.0</strong> to <strong>1.0</strong>
inclusive,  				regardless of their internal or external representation.</p>
 			
<p>Audio data processed by VST Plug-Ins are <em>32 bit floating-point</em>
numbers.  				They must always range from <strong>-1.0 </strong>to<strong>
+1.0</strong> inclusive.</p>
 			<br>
 			
<h2>Plug-In implementation</h2>
 			
<p>If you want to develop a VST Plug-In, you may prefer to go straight to
the code  				examples now. These are very simple examples in which you will
learn most of  				the important basic concepts just by reading a few lines
of code.</p>
 			
<p>As a Plug-In developer you actually need to know very little about hosting
a  				Plug-In. You should concentrate on the <strong>AudioEffect</strong>
and <strong>AudioEffectX</strong> 				base classes. 			</p>
 			
<p><strong>AudioEffect</strong> is the base class, which represents VST 1.0
 				plugs-ins, and has its declarations in <a
 href="../../source/common/audioeffect.hpp" target="blank"> 					audioeffect.hpp</a>,
and the implementation in <a href="../../source/common/audioeffect.cpp"
 target="blank"> 					audioeffect.cpp</a>. You will also need to be aware
of the structure  				definitions in <a
 href="../../source/common/aeffect.h" target="blank">aeffect.h</a>.</p>
 			
<p>The files <a href="../../source/common/aeffectx.h" target="blank">aeffectx.h</a> 
				(more structures), <a href="../../source/common/audioeffectx.h"
 target="blank">audioeffectx.h</a>,  				and <a
 href="../../source/common/audioeffectx.cpp" target="blank">audioeffectx.cpp</a> 
				are similar to the ones above, and extend them to the version 2.3  				specification.</p>
 			<br>
 			
<h2>X marks the Spot</h2>
 			
<p>The files relating to the 2.3 specification have their counterparts in
the  				original 1.0 specification. The original files are expanded upon
by versions  				representing the 2.3 specification. Basically the new classes
files all have a  				1.0 predecessor but the new ones have an X in the name. 
			</p>
 			
<p><b><a href="../../source/common/aeffectx.h" target="blank">aeffectx.h</a>
</b> 				includes <a href="../../source/common/aeffect.hpp"
 target="blank">aeffect.hpp</a><br>
 				<a href="../../source/common/audioeffectx.h" target="blank">audioeffectx.h</a> 
				includes <a href="../../source/common/audioeffect.hpp"
 target="blank">audioeffect.hpp</a> 				and 				<br>
 				<a href="../../source/common/audioeffectx.cpp" target="blank">audioeffectx.cpp</a> 
				extends the implementation in <a
 href="../../source/common/audioeffect.cpp" target="blank"> 					audioeffect.cpp</a>
through the 				<br>
 				<b>AudioEffectX</b> class, which inherits from <b>AudioEffect</b> and
thus is  				compatible to the 1.0 specs. 				<br>
 				<br>
 				<br>
 			</p>
 			
<h2>Don't Edit. Inherit</h2>
 			
<p>Never edit any of these files. Never ever. The host application relies
on them  				being used as they are provided. Anything can be added or changed
by overriding  				in your private classes derived from <strong>AudioEffectX</strong>.</p>
 			<br>
 			
<h2>User Interfaces</h2>
 			
<p>All user-interface issues are entirely separated from the audio processing
 				issues. At its simplest there is an option where you can avoid providing
a user  				interface at all. In this case the host requests character strings
from the  				Plug-In representing each of the parameters. The host can use
the separate  				ASCII strings for the value, the label, and the units of
the parameters to  				construct its own user interface. This is how the
simple code-examples, AGain  				&amp; ADelay, work. This is also often a
good way to develop a VST Plug-In, it  				offers a very short development
cycle to start to test the algorithm. The  				proper interface can come
later.</p>
 			
<p>The next user interface level is provided when the Plug-In defines its
own  				editor. This allows practically any user interface to be defined.
A negative  				aspect is that then you can quickly land up in platform specifics
when dealing  				with the nuts an bolts of the interface issues, even though
the audio process,  				the concepts and methodology remain platform independent.</p>
 			
<p>The final option is to use a portable framework for creating sophisticated
user  				interfaces. This framework takes the form of the VSTGUI Library
files that are  				available for all supported VST platforms. Apart from
converting a few pictures  				from one resource format to another, for which
there are tools available, and  				setting up the initial project files,
writing a VST 2.3 Plug-In can really be  				completely cross-platform (some
given examples: ControlsGUI, ADelayEditGUI,  				SurroundDelay). VSTGUI Library
files and their usage is completely described in  				the HMTL files that
accompany this SDK. After reading about the underlying  				issues in this
document and associated code examples, the VSTGUI comes very  				highly
recommended.</p>

<h2>Thanks &amp; Acknowledgements</h2>
 			
<p>The VSTGUI interfaces &amp; Libraries were created by Wolfgang Kundrus
and Yvan  				Grabit (additional developing Matthias Juwan, Arne Sheffler).
The time they  				have invested has really made the huge inroads into cross-platform
code  				compatibility.</p>
 			
<p>Thanks too, to Philippe Goutier who provided the VST Offline Interface.</p>
 			
<p>Not forgetting Dave Nicholson,&nbsp;Julien Junod, Pierre Jean Camillieri,
Janne  				Roeper&nbsp;who did some additional typing.</p>
 			
<p>There were many more people involved in the creation of this interface,
not all  				of whom can be mentioned here. We extend our thanks not just
to the Steinberg  				Staff and Associates that contributed but also to the
many other developers  				from other parties have helped with their input
- mainly all the nice people on  				the VST Plug-In DEVELOPER MAILING LIST 
			</p>
 			
<p>Thanks to all of you for having made this possible. 			</p>
